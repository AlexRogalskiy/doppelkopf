# Contributing

Hey there! Happy to have you here <3
We welcome all contributions, minor and major, from everyone.

By participating in this project, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hamvocke/doppelkopf/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

As this project is still young, we don't have a lot of guidelines for contributing yet. We'll figure them out as we go. Here are a few things to consider:

## Getting started
The [Readme](https://github.com/hamvocke/doppelkopf/blob/master/README.md) has instructions how to start coding on your machine.

## Things to work on
If you're looking for things to work on, the [Roadmap](https://github.com/hamvocke/doppelkopf/projects/1) shows an overview over features, ideas and bugs that we want to address in the near future. The [issue tracker](https://github.com/hamvocke/doppelkopf/issues) is another good source of information.

Apart from code contributions, there are many other things you could contribute to this project:
    * bug reports
    * feature ideas
    * wireframes and design sketches
    * typo fixes, copy tweaks
    * learning material
    * promotional stuff

## Submitting your work
* Submit a *pull request* for code changes
* Create an *issue* for bug reports, feature requests, questions, discussions, ideas
* When in doubt, or if you don't want to discuss things publicly, reach out to us [via email](mailto:ham@hamvocke.com)

## Pull Requests
When you submit a pull request, we're looking for a few things before we will consider merging it into master. You'll see a list of things to check when submitting your pull request. To make things more smooth, please try to think about these requirements before submitting. Don't let these requirements discourage you from participating if they seem overwhelming or unclear. We will be able to work through these together once you submit a pull request.
